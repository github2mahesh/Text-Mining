# Text Mining

**Welcome!** This repository contains my lab assignments from the **Text Mining** course.

**What will you find here?**

* **Five Jupyter Notebook files (.ipynb):** Each notebook represents a different lab assignment, covering the following topics:
    * **Lab 1 - Information Retrieval:** Implementing techniques for retrieving relevant information from a large collection of text documents.
    * **Lab 2 - Text Classification:** Building machine learning models to classify text documents into predefined categories or labels.
    * **Lab 3 - Text Clustering and Topic Modeling:** Exploring clustering algorithms and topic modeling techniques to group similar documents and identify latent topics within a corpus.
    * **Lab 4 - Information Extraction:** Extracting structured information from unstructured text data using techniques such as named entity recognition and relation extraction.
    * **Lab 5 - Large Language Models and Text Summarization:** Training large language models and developing algorithms for generating concise summaries of text documents.

* **Text Mining Project:** This contains code and a project report for a text mining project, covering problem formulation, data collection, method implementation, experimentation, evaluation, and conclusions.
* 
**Disclaimer:** This repository serves as a personal learning portfolio and does not claim to provide complete solutions or code for specific assignments. It is intended to showcase learning progress and applied skills in text mining and natural language processing techniques.
